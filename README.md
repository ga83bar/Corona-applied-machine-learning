## Project Description
The goal of this project is to model current and future greenhouse gas emissions arising from internet traffic in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, utilizing a machine learning approach. Prior to the outbreak of Covid-19 it was already predicted that increased internet traffic would result in a continuing rise of greenhouse gas emissions. Pre-Covid-19, web traffic experienced a growth of roughly 30% per annum. Based on recent growth data in internet traffic caused by the pandemic, we want to quantify the irregular rise of greenhouse gas contribution. The model and resulting predictions should be made accessible to a wider public, with the help of an interactive web interface.

## Research Question
To concisely formulate the scope of our project, we pose the following research question: What will the global quantitative impact of increased Internet traffic due to Corona on green- house gas emissions be?

## Goals
Over the course of this project, we want to generate a model that predicts greenhouse gas emissions from increased internet traffic as accurately as possible. The predictions should be visually and interactively accessible with a web interface. Users should be able to interact with the model by entering various scenarios, such as differing curves for the progression of the pandemic. The project is finished once the generated model is integrated with a working web interface, and the progress and project achievements are video-documented.

## Approaches
The problem is approached via data driven analysis. At the start of the project, we plan on collecting any data we can find on the energy consumption of data centres and internet infrastructure or internet traffic. We will also gather information on the current greenhouse gas emissions for power generation, as well as the historical development of greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries. Combined with the data on web traffic and its increase due to COVID-19, a variety of machine learning models will be trained to predict the increase in emissions during the pandemic. Future emission predictions will rely on forecasts about the course of the pandemic, or will be predictively generated based on past data. For the web interface, we plan on using the Chart.js framework to create a visually appealing and interactive environment.
