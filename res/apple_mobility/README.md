# README for the Apple mobility dataset


## Data origin
The data for this data set was downloaded from the official [apple website](https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility). It contains mobility data sorted
by country based on the percentage of navigation assistance requests compared to a normal level issued by apple users.

## Code for scraping
There was no need to scrape the data, the data set is already available for download as CSV file.

## Code for preprocessing

Preprocessing was also not necessary. A short inspection of the data showed that it was in excellent shape and the only missing values have been clearly marked in the description.
