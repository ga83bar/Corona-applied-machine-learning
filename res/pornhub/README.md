# README for the Pornhub dataset

## About
Worldwide traffic to Pornhub continues to be much higher than it was before the Coronavirus pandemic spread worldwide. The peak increase of 24.4% happened on March 25th after we offered Free Pornhub Premium to encourage people to say indoors and distance themselves socially.

## Data origin
The data comes from the official [Pornhub statistics website](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/coronavirus-update-may-26).

## Code for preprocessing
The data can be found in the [PornhubCollector](/src/data_management/data_collection.py) class.

## Data
The processed data contains the attributes 
  - Date
  - daily increase in traffic

The interesting thing about the data is the significant increase in the number of users from/on the first day of the lockdown.
