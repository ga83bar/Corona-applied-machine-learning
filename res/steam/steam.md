# README FOR STEAM DATASET

## DATA ORIGIN
ASK: Henrique

## CODE FOR OBTAINING AND PREPROCESSING
[SteamCollector](/./src/data_management/data_collection.py)

## DATA
The processed data contains the attributes :
  - Date
  - number of Users
  - number of players In-Game

We hope that the data will give us insight into the social behaviour of people. It can be assumed that the number of players will increase from the time of the lockdown. It is conceivable that the increase in players correlates with the number of unemployed.
