# Quick Summary
Predictive time series modeling is a more or less standard problem in the field of statistical modeling for which many different approaches exist. One of the main goals during the AMI project is to evaluate some of these candidate model approaches and to eventually decide for one that suits the project task at hand. This underlying document thus presents a quick & dirty analysis of three possible learning approaches and discusses their respective feasibility.  

# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

# Gaussian Processes

# Extreme Learning Machines
