 As discussed within the ML readme, data is split into two separate sets\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item One pre-\/\+Covid-\/19 set, with the intent to predict baseline markers
\item And one post Covid-\/19 set, with the intent to predict error margins
\end{DoxyItemize}

Both sets contain timeseries data on Covid-\/19 indicators and markers.

 The challenge with time series data is the inability to split data into a useful training/testing set. This is due to the fact that learning time series data requires some form of process with memory.

As such, the datasets remain unsplit.
