\doxysection*{Data origin}

The data for this data set was scraped from \href{https://twitchtracker.com/statistics}{\texttt{ twitchtracker}}, a website that tracks statistics for number of viewers, total viewtime etc. We thought this data might be interesting as we expected a steep increase in live streaming due to the Corona crisis.

\doxysection*{Code for scraping}

Scraping the data was pretty straightforward, as all of it could be scraped with a single request to the website. The code for scraping is directly integrated into the processing of the data, see \href{\#Code-for-preprocessing}{\texttt{ Code for preprocessing}}.

\doxysection*{Code for preprocessing}

Proprocessing was done by simply reading the raw data into a pandas frame. The website had exceptionally well managed data points, so there was no need to do extensive preprocessing. The source code for preprocessing is located in the \href{../../src/data_management/twitch_processing.py}{\texttt{ twitch\+\_\+processing.\+py}} file.
