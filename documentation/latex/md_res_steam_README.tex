\doxysection*{Data origin}

The data was downloaded from the \href{https://steamdb.info/app/753/graphs/}{\texttt{ steam database website}}.

\doxysection*{Code for obtaining and preprocessing}

The code can be found in the \href{/src/data_management/data_collection.py}{\texttt{ Steam\+Collector}} class.

\doxysection*{Data}

The processed data contains the attributes \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Date
\item number of Users
\item number of players In-\/\+Game
\end{DoxyItemize}

We hope that the data will give us insight into the social behaviour of people. It can be assumed that the number of players will increase from the time of the lockdown. It is conceivable that the increase in players correlates with the number of unemployed.
