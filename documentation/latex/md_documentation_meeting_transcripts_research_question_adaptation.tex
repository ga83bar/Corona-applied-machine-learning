\doxysection*{Problem Statement}

As discussed below, most of the collected candidate data sets {\bfseries{do not qualify}} as valid ML model entries. This is mainly due to the fact that either the {\bfseries{amount}} -\/ and thus the {\bfseries{representative time window}} -\/ is insufficient or because of the observation that some of the respective data sets show {\bfseries{significant discontinuities}} which cannot be explained by the model. The latter ones are particularly prevalent in the Social\+Crawler You\+Tube reference data set which can be seen in below figure for the respective {\bfseries{subscriber count}}.



Considering these major drawbacks, the remaining data is {\bfseries{scarce}} and thus {\bfseries{not informative enough}} for a detailed investigation of above initial problem statement. In particular, the remaining {\bfseries{usable}} data sets are\+: a) Internet Exchange Points b) C\+O\+V\+I\+D-\/19 data c) Google Trends d) Gaming e) Twitch Streaming

\doxysection*{Reformulating the Project Proposal}

Consequently, we have decided to expand the horizon of the project by adding the {\bfseries{economic dimension}} to the problem at hand. By doing this, we can not only interpret the impact of the pandemic on the remaining data sets on online activity but also investigate the {\bfseries{concurrent economic developments}} of the past few months. In particular, this also allows to {\bfseries{draw conclusions}} between both of these domains by analyzing companies that are somewhat related to online traffic -\/ such as Google, Netflix, Zoom, etc -\/ and their respective {\bfseries{economic performance}} during the pandemic. Consequently, another interpretation can be made between $\ast$$\ast$\char`\"{}the new tech\char`\"{}$\ast$$\ast$ and $\ast$$\ast$\char`\"{}the old\char`\"{}$\ast$$\ast$ by comparing the economic impact of the pandemic to aforementioned {\bfseries{technology giants}} and some more traditional areas such as the {\bfseries{oil and steel industry}}. Furthermore, there are {\bfseries{many accessible A\+P\+Is}} for stock markets which are of a {\bfseries{high data resolution}} and more importantly go {\bfseries{way farther back in time}} than the You\+Tube reference data set.

We thus believe that above adaptation of the initial project proposal is only {\bfseries{reasonable}} considering the {\bfseries{insufficiency of the obtained data sets}}. Furthermore, it does not significantly change the main project idea and/or motivation but surely {\bfseries{expands its perspective}} allowing for an even {\bfseries{more coherent}} interpretation and conclusion.
