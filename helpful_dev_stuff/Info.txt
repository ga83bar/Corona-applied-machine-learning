- For using it you just have to make this kind of comments - '''Simple Python doxy comment'' - in your function.
- You just have to download doxygen (LINUX: sudo apt-get install doxygen)
- the system is ready to use (LINUX: in the current working directory --> CWD doxygen aml_doxy_conf.dxy
- Then go to documentation/latex and make the .pdf file (LINUX : make)

(2) Filepaths :
- as we probably will/must work with different operating systems use the command -os.path.join() - to create paths!!!

(3) Python : virtual enviroment

(4) Interfaces :
- Informations of how to implement this Interfaces :
  https://www.python-course.eu/python3_abstract_classes.php
- The extrem short version would be 
   * inherit interface to your class (ideally with the same name only without i) e.g. class Data(iData): .....
   * copy the methods and overwrite them =)


(5) Packages : 
- pip install SomePackage>=1.0.4 (set minimum version to 1.0.4)
